    <h1>Get to Know Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a web developer with a business degree, but my journey into tech started with a desire to help my partner with his capstone project.
         Little did I know, I would fall in love with web development! I found the process of building and creating websites incredibly rewarding, 
         so I decided to pursue it on my own. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me hiking, kayaking, or playing video games. I also love creating art 
         and spending time with my cats. Oh, and if you ever want to chat about movies, Alien is my all-time favorite. </p>
